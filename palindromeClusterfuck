#META comment for Reddit: what follows this line is a description of the problem for my coding buddies. Then there's my code, with a mixture of comments to myself (evolving on random lines as my understanding of the issue evolves) and to my coding buddies.

#I'm not interested in making this code more elegant or efficient.
#I know it's probably a mess with way too many lines of code.
#I'm interested in understanding why things aren't working the way I expect.
#This was a great learning experience in trying out new concepts and troubleshooting.
#I solved a lot of problems by googling docs, trial and error, clarifying what I
#want to do, examining steps of the code to see if they're working right, etc.
#But I've reached a point where I'm stuck.
#The goal is to find the highest palindrome out of the products of two-digit numbers. (Actually, three-digit, but I can scale that up later.)
#The highest palindrome should be 9009.
#It generates all the palindromes (and the products that surround them) just fine. But it's supposed to append them to a list,
#and it stops appending after 676. That's waaaayyyyyyy too soon. Something goes wrong between product generation and final list creation.
#All the palindromes that get appended are squares: 11*11=121, 22*22=484, 26*26=676. (I feel pretty smart for figuring this out.)
#The method I came up with for multiplying the numbers is this: (Yeah I'm bragging about my method, it's probably the only clever thing in this idiotic code, except OOPS it doesn't work everywhere.)
#10x10 end 10 loop
#11x10
#11x11 end 11 loop
#12x10
#12x11
#12x12 end 12 loop
#This is where I suspect the error is occuring-- it is only returning palindromes that 
#pop up at the very last iteration of the loop that matches the first number with all the
#numbers it's multiplied by. So 22x22 successfully returns 484 to wherever it needs to go
#for the final output, BUT if say 22X15 were to produce a palindrome, that wouldn't wind up
#where it needs to be, EVEN THOUGH all products DO wind up in testList and reverseList, which
#is where I thought my final answer was being pulled from. 
#OK... after typing all that, I finally discovered that z and product do not match. product only contains products returned at 
#end of the loop for each value of y.
#The issue is probably the worst practice I used in assigning global z inside the function.
#But this is where my knowledge of functions comes to and end. I don't see why z is fine, but saying product = z only captures
#part of z.
#Later edit, just before posting to r/badcode: Holy shit!! I put print(z) inside the for x loop, and z prints the same list as product!!! So maybe the issue isn't
#in how the value of z is preserved outside the function, but in how the x and y loops interact. 
#Well, since the y loop accepts all the x's it needs from the x loop just fine,
#I guess the problem is in at what point the x loop loops...
# for x in range(10,100):, so each loop is 10, then 11, then 12... corresponding to the second number that gets multiplied in the
# while y loop... once y's value matches x, the for x loop iterates with the next value of x... or does it... let's work this out...
# while y < 10:
#   y = 9 + 1
#   z = 10 * 10
# while y < 11:
#   y = 9 + 1
#   z = 10 * 11
#   y = 10 + 1
#   z = 11 * 11
# while y < 12:
#   y = 9 + 1
#   z = 10 * 12
#   y = 10 + 1
#   z = 11 * 12
#   y = 11 + 1
#   z = 12 * 12
# So... y does its thing on x just fine. mult(x) completes when the two numbers match. And the for x loop only takes the most
#recent value for z at the end of the function. So that's why my for x loop only works with the squares returned by the mult(x) function.
#Cool... all I have to do is, uh... rearrange my two loops completely?


def mult(x): # This works with x in range(10,100) to multiply all the 2-digit numbers by each other.
    global z
    y = 9
    while y < x:
        y = y + 1
        z = y * x
        print('z: ', z) # GOOD, prints ALL products
#mult()

#for x in range(10,100): #This is commented out because it's part of a bigger loop below.
   # mult()

finalistList = []

for x in range(10, 100):
    mult(x)
    print('z in x loop: ', z) #Even though this is one of the first tests, it is the absolute last one I did, JUST NOW, and unveiled a major misconception I had about the behavior of z.
    product = z # z is assigned in mult() 
    print('product: ', product) #AHA!!!! Here's the problem: product and z do not match. product only preserves z at end of each y loop. 
    productToString = str(product)
    testList = [productToString]
    #print('testList high up: ', testList) #GOOD; prints ALL products. ACTUALLY, NO. only prints product. Couldn't tell until I labeled z separately.
    reverseList = [productToString]
    # print('reverseList: ', reverseList) GOOD; prints ALL products.
    testList[0:] = testList[0] # This line is unnecessary... whoops, maybe not. Disabling it populates finalistList with some non-palindromes.
    #print('testList: ', testList) # GOOD... but... only displays last item at this stage. So can't see if it's lost items.
    reverseList[0:] = reverseList[0]
    #print('reverseList: ', reverseList) #GOOD... ditto.
    reverseList = list(reversed(testList))
    #print('reverseList: ', reverseList) # GOOD (turn on to troubleshoot)

        finalistList.append(product)

        # [121, 484, 676] (11*11, 22*22, 26*26)
        # All cubes-- is something only happening at the end of the while y < x: loop?
        # Craps out after 26*26. No more palindromes are appended after 270 (27*10). Next palindrome is 616 (
        # Gap between 702 (27*26) and 729 (27*27).
        # Next palindrome is 616 (28*22)
    testList = []
    reverseList = []

print('finalistList: ', finalistList)
print('Largest multiple of two 2-digit numbers that is a palindrome: ', finalistList[-1]) #I think there is an off-by-one error here that is DEFINITELY NOT the [-1], but I'll worry about that later.
